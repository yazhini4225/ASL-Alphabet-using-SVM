# 🤟 ASL Alphabet Recognition using Linear SVM

## 📘 Project Overview
This project focuses on building an **American Sign Language (ASL) alphabet recognition system** using the **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** algorithm with a **linear kernel**.  
The goal is to classify static ASL hand gesture images (A–Z) into their corresponding alphabets using image processing and machine learning.

It uses the **ASL Alphabet Dataset** from Kaggle and processes images using **OpenCV**, training a **Linear SVM** for multi-class classification.

## 🎯 Objective
To create a machine learning model that can automatically recognize **ASL alphabets (A–Z)** from hand gesture images using the **SVM (linear kernel)** classifier.

## 📂 Dataset Information

**Dataset:** [ASL Alphabet Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/grassknoted/asl-alphabet)

### 🧾 Dataset Description
- Contains **26 folders (A–Z)**, and a few additional ones (`nothing`, `space`, `delete`).
- Each folder contains thousands of images representing a specific ASL gesture.
- Each image represents one letter of the ASL alphabet.
- Images are RGB with a size of **200×200 pixels**.

This dataset helps in training a supervised learning model for **image-based gesture classification**.
